This is a simple resume builder application that I built as a way to learn using React! The main area of focus for me in this app was to learn the ways to render components to the DOM using React, rather than standard Javascript. Managing of state was another area of focus of mine for this as I begin to learn React. This app isn't meant to be super functional, more so just to develop the skills needed to learn and use react.
